# Rainbow-Web-SDK-Samples-v2

This project is build following the starting guides available in on the public Rainbow Developpers website (https://developers.openrainbow.com/)

The idea is to have a quick starting app written in TypeScript (no framework) to show some basic implementations of the APIs that are avaialbe in the SDK Web (available on npm, "rainbow-web-sdk").

To build & start the project, you'll need to a dev IDE of your choice, clone the project; install the prerequis described on the starting guides for SDK Web (node, rollup, etc) and then do:

`npm i`
`npm run build`
`npm run serve`

Now you've the project available on your localhost. 

** In order to know how to create your test app and obtain the application ID, please refer to the public website of Rainbow Developpers **
